# Live Feed Test
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TimothyLe/live-feed-test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TimothyLe/live-feed-test)  
A data retrieval tool that simplifies cross origin HTTP requests (or CORS) and minimizes the work needed to done with tokens and etc.   
**Work In Progress**  
This project is not yet ready for use and still runs into issues with requests in a Chrome Browser where it is being tested.

## Project
This is a solo project where I will be conducting tests with parsing JSON data through AJAX Http requests. 

## Goal
After completion of receiving live data and refreshing the feed, I hope to turn this project into an application that can be used on mobile devices to demonstrate skills of not only using Javascript but also scalability onto other platforms. This may also turn into a web extension or mobile application (this is currently under consideration).
