# Live Feed Test
![https://travis-ci.org/TimothyLe/live-feed-test.svg?branch=master](https://travis-ci.org/TimothyLe/live-feed-test)
An assessment of utilizing HTML, Javascript, and CSS files to create an application that can receive update from the web without including the data already inside the code. 

## Project
This is a solo project where I will be conducting tests with parsing JSON data through AJAX's XML Http requests. 

## Goal
After completion of receiving live data and refreshing the feed, I hope to turn this project into an application that can be used on mobile devices to demonstrate skills of not only using Javascript but also scalability onto other platforms. Perhaps the second half will require using a tool such as Android Studio and editing in XML/Java.
